    unset(var); make that var NULL;
    if used in array it will remove that element like
    [0]=>0,[1]=>1,[2]=>2,[3]=>3,[4]=>4,[5]=>5
    element 3
    then array will look like
    [0]=>0,[1]=>1,[2]=>2,[4]=>4,[5]=>5
    in this index is not serialized but it has removed element 3

    to make array serialized we have to use
    array_value($array);
    it will change the index of element to
    [0]=>0,[1]=>1,[2]=>2,[3]=>4[4]=>5
